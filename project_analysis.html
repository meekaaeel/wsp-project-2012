                <h1>Project Analysis: Orlando Furniture Direct</h1>
                
                <h2>Site Intent</h2>
                
                    <p>From a basic monetary standpoint, any re-design of a site would be to attract more traffic to the site for an increased revenue, but the real purpose for any site should be to give the visitors to your site a memorable experience with your site. One in which the user can easily understand and navigate thru-out the site with no difficulty. Also the information displayed on the site should be presented in the best form to optimize and achieve the goal of the re-design. My idea on addressing some of the issue in the present site would be to condense specific pages into leaner ones and group existing images in a different manner based on importance. Also I would change the color scheme to be more appealing than the generic white background. Clickable items such as store coupons or information forms should be listed together and easily understood.</p>
                
                <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
                
                    <p>How successful any particular site is depends, in my opinion, and by research, is it's ability to be viable on the web. More importantly how does the site stand up against its competitor's. Can the site be easily found in the rankings of most search engine's optimization. For that matter how does the site rate in that search. As for the present site,<em>"Orlando Furniture Direct,"</em> it could not be found under that name, but a secondary search using the name <em>"Orlando Clearance Mattress.com and Mattress.com,</em> brought up a result of a ranking of 66,758 in the United States. Taking this into consideration, we need to address on this site, what's working for the competition nationally and duplicate or at least improve upon this site's standing over-all.</p>
                
                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                    <p>Based on what was identified as the internet average user to the site <em>Mattress.com,</em> it appears that females who's ages range from 35-44 and who are college educated, were the most frequent visitors to the site. there where only a few case of woman with children noted and no men. so it stands to reason that here the main target audience is young women and with that in mine our site should be gear to a more female based site with designs focused on that  assumption.</p>
